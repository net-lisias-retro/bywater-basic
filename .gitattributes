# NOTE: Since these sources could be compiled in DOS and Win the line
# endings are forced to CRLF for compatibility with those
# environments. Its likely they won't have access to GIT and the files
# will come from a Linux host, which would automatically force use LF.
# Since UNIX usually can handle both gracefully I'm mostly forcing
# this repo to CRLF.

# OK so I'm (ChipMaster) apparently not smart enough so here goes plan
# "b" for handling line endings.
