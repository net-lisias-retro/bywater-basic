    It is possible to increase the size of a file.  Each file has 
an associated SIZE file created with it and maintained throughout 
its  life.  For  the  GL file (for example) this file  is  called 
GLSIZE.

    When examined using any CPM Editor this file will be found to 
contain  two  numbers separated by a comma such  as  38,100.  The 
first number is the NEXT AVAILABLE RECORD.  The second number  is 
the TOTAL RECORDS.

    The following steps will allow the file size to be increased.

1.  Use  any  CPM  Editor to enter the xxSIZE file as  you  would 
    enter any document file.

2.  Change  the number AFTER the comma to the new file  size  you 
    desire.

3.  Exit from the editor and erase any .BAK file.

4.  Immediately  start the system and proceed with the  necessary 
    menu  calls  to  the General Ledger Entry  program  (in  this 
    example) or whatever file you are changing.

5.  Immediately  do  a BACK-UP AND SORT  operation.  The  numbers 
    shown  in the menu before the BACK-UP AND SORT operation will 
    be the new numbers you have entered but the actual data  file 
    WILL  NOT have been increased in size to accomodate the extra 
    records.  Running the BACK-UP AND SORT operation is the  ONLY 
    way to physically increase the size of the data file.

    Obviously  it is better to create a file with ample space  to 
begin with but Murphy's Law DOES prevail.
