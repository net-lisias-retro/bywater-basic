# bywater basic (bw-basic)

The Bywater BASIC Interpreter (bwBASIC) implements a large superset of the ANSI Standard for Minimal BASIC (X3.60-1978) and a significant subset of the ANSI Standard for Full BASIC (X3.113-1987) in C.

This is Lisias' fork, aimed to historical reference and experimentation.
