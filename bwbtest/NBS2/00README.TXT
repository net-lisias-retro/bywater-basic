This folder contains a large number of BASIC programs
to test conformance to ANSI Minimal BASIC,
as documented in ECMA-55.TXT.  The file ECMA-55.TXT 
originally came from http://sourceforge.net/projects/buraphakit/.
The tests are described in NBS_minimal_BASIC_test_programs_vol1.txt.


The P###.* files implement the "NBS Minimal BASIC Test Programs—Version 2",
which is described in the file "NBS_minimal_BASIC_test_programs_vol1.txt".
The P###.* files originally came from http://sourceforge.net/projects/buraphakit/.
The P###.* files have been updated for bwBASIC by Howard Wulf, AF5NE.
By design, bwBASIC does not pass test number P062.
