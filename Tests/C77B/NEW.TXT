                        System Operation

    In  the next few pages we are going to cover the operation of 
the BusinessMaster series of software.  After initial setup,  the 
package is for the most part self-explanatory.

    We  will  start this process by covering in some  detail  the 
establishment  of  a  Chart of Accounts and the  entry  of  these 
accounts via the General Ledger Entry program.  This is a typical 
entry program and will serve to give you a sound understanding of 
the later data entry programs.

    Your  Chart  of  Accounts should first be planned  using  the 
forms in Appendix G.  A sample set of these forms is shown in the 
next few pages.

The  General  Ledger  program  package allows  a  great  deal  of 
flexibility with few restrictions:

1.  Account numbers MUST be numeric. They cannot include imbedded 
punctuation marks or alphabetic characters. They must each be the 
same length and can be up to 10 digits long.

2.   Account  numbers  MUST be entered in  ascending  order  from 
lowest  being  ASSETS  to highest being EXPENSES.  The  order  is 
ASSETS,  LIABILITIES,  EQUITY,  SALES,  and EXPENSES.  An example 
would  be Assets from 100 to 199;  Liabilities from 200  to  299; 
Equity  from  300 to 399;  Sales (revenue) from 400 to  499;  and 
Expenses from 900 to 999.

3.   Account  names  may  be  up to 30  characters  long  but  we 
recommend keeping them under 24 characters since some programs on 
8.5 inch wide paper will only print 24 characters.

                Setting Up the Chart of Accounts.

    The  actual procedure for establishing a Chart of Account  in 
this  system is quite simple.  A group of forms (Appendix G)   is 
provided  for your convenience in establishing  account  numbers, 
headings, and subheadings.

    All  posting  and printing operations in the  General  Ledger 
depend on the numbering conventions established here. Notice that 
the "Current Assets" subheading in the first table is followed by 
four accounts.  These are numbered 102, 105, 110, and 132. In the 
SUBHEADING table,  the first and second account numbers are given 
as  102 and 132.  These two numbers define the ABSOLUTE range  of 
account  numbers  for  this  particular  subheading.   This  same 
convention must be followed with all account numbering.

    It  should  be noted here that all entry programs follow  the 
general pattern illustrated in the following material.

    Type  crun2 bizmii followed by the return key.  This  is  the 
preamble to starting the system for all operations.

The following MENU will appear on the screen.

*** BUSINESSMASTER X MASTER MENU ***

1 - GENERAL LEDGER/GENERAL JOURNAL OPERATIONS

2 - ORDER ENTRY/RECEIVABLES OPERATIONS

3 - PURCHASE ORDER/PAYABLES OPERATIONS

4 - INVENTORY OPERATIONS

5 - EMPLOYEE PAYROLL OPERATIONS

6 - MAILING LIST OPERATIONS

7 - INITIALIZE SYSTEM/START-UP/MODIFY SYSTEM

8 - PERIODIC FILE MAINTENANCE

9 - FINISHED

    Typing  the  appropriate number followed by  carriage  return 
(RETURN) will bring up the desired new menu.

    Typing 1 followed by return will bring up the following menu.

*** GENERAL LEDGER - JOURNAL MENU ***

6 - PRINT BALANCE SHEET

7 - PRINT INCOME STATEMENTS

8 - PRINT BUDGET ANALYSIS

9 - FINISHED
.pa
    Type a 1 followed by return.

    The system will respond by clearing the screen and presenting 
the General Ledger Data Entry menu.

    If  at this point there is no General Ledger file,  the  next 
message is

IF YOU HAVE ARRIVED HERE,  AND HAVE A GENERAL LEDGER FILE ALREADY 
ON  A DISK,  YOU SHOULD INSTALL THAT DISK THEN TYPE THE LETTER  C 
FOLLOWED BY RETURN TO CONTINUE.

IF  YOU WISH TO CREATE A NEW FILE,  TYPE THE LETTER N FOLLOWED BY 
RETURN.

    Notice  that if the drive is not up or the wrong disk  is  in 
place  this same message will be printed.  In that  case,  simply 
bring the drive up by installing the correct disk and closing the 
drive door.

    In this case we want to create a new file.  Typing N followed 
by return will give the following message

NUMBER OF RECORDS DESIRED?

    Answer with the desired number of records. This number should 
be  at least 25% more than the number of records (general  ledger 
accounts) you actually intend to use.  The requirement to add two 
accounts to a file that only has one record left can be less than 
desireable.

    After taking the time required to create the new records, the 
system will respond with

GENERAL LEDGER FILE CREATED AND CLEARED.
 nnnn RECORDS CREATED.
TO CONTINUE, TYPE RETURN.

where nnnn is the number of records created in the file.

    After typing return, the system will respond with

1       Tag                    4    N    This numeric entry is used as a  sort 
                                         parameter. It must be non-zero and is 
                                         best  used  as  a  sequential  record 
                                         number.

2       Ledger Account Number  10   N    This  is  the actual  General  Ledger 
                                         Account  number.  If the accounts  in 
                                         this  file  are changed,  be sure  to 
                                         check that the ranges established  in 
                                         the General Ledger TABS file, General 
                                         Ledger  Headings  and General  Ledger 
                                         Subheadings are still correct.

3       Description            30   A    This is the description such as "Cash 
                                         in  Bank" that will be used for  this 
                                         account number.

4       Month to date amount   12   N    This and the next five entries  carry 
                                         the  accrued  dollar  figures  posted 
                                         from  other programs.  These  figures 
                                         should  seldom  be  altered  directly 
                                         except  to to fill in figures if  the 
                                         system  is set up in the middle of  a 
                                         year.
 
                                         When  a  Chart of Accounts  is  first 
                                         developed,  the TAG,  ACCOUNT NUMBER, 
                                         and  DESCRIPTION should be filled in. 
                                         The file should then be sorted on the 
                                         ACCOUNT  NUMBER (selection A  in  the 
                                         sort routine) to sort the accounts in 
                                         ascending  order.   On  exitting  the 
                                         program,  a  General Ledger Reference 
                                         file  will automatically  be  created 
                                         which contains the account numbers in 
                                         ascending order.  This Reference file 
                                         is  called  into main  memory  during 
                                         posting and other operations to allow 
                                         the swift location of account numbers 
                                         for posting and validation.

                                         Amounts  posted  are  added  to  this 
                                         field  and the next five fields.  The 
                                         monthly  maintenance  program   zeros 
                                         this  field out when it is run.  This 
                                         should  be  done at the end  of  each 
                                         months accounting activity.

5       Quarter to date amount 12   N    This value is added to by the posting 
                                         programs and zeroed out at the end of 
                                         each quarter by running the quarterly 
                                         maintenance program.

6       Year to date amount    12   N    This value is added to by the posting 
                                         programs and zeroed out at the end of 
                                         each  year  by  running  the   yearly 
                                         maintenance program.

7       Previous M-T-D amount  12   N    See above.

8       Previous Q-T-D amount  12   N    See above.

9       Previous Y-T-D amount  12   N    See above.

10      Budgeted amount        12   N    Any  expense,  cost of goods or other 
                                         item may be assigned a budget amount. 
                                         These  values MUST be  entered  here. 
                                         These figures will be used to prepare 
                                         a  comprehensive budget report at the 
                                         end of each month.

    After  all  accounts have been entered they should be  sorted 
using  the BACK-UP AND SORT FILE menu call (#7).  When  the  sort 
program  asks  for  Sort by Tag or Account  #,  answer  with  the 
appropriate  response  (A) for account number to ensure that  the 
accounts are in ascending numeric order by account number.

    The  accounts  can now be listed (menu call #8). 

    It  is  now possible to examine the accounts to  ensure  that 
they are exactly what you want.  The lion's share of the work  is 
now done in establishing your general ledger system.

#2 - GENERAL LEDGER FORMATS

    The General Ledger FORMATS file allows the numeric format  of 
    some  statements to be set.  Instructions for entering  these 
    are given in the program that creates the file.

Item #  Description            Size/Type Entry

1       Dollar formats         20   A    This  will  normally  take  the  form 
                                         #,###,###.##.  This is called a PRINT 
                                         USING string.  It allows the printing 
                                         of 9,999,999.99.  This can be changed 
                                         if desired...  for example ##,###,### 
                                         would    allow   the   printing    of 
                                         99,999,999.  A  minor  caution  here, 
                                         dropping  pennies  in this  way  will 
                                         cause TRUNCATION rather than ROUNDING 
                                         even though the correct figures would 
                                         still  be present in the files.  Thus 
                                         99.35  would  print as 99  and  99.85 
                                         would  also print as 99  even  though 
                                         both  figures  remained as shown  for 
                                         calculation  purposes.   The  pennies 
                                         would NOT be dropped,  they would not 
                                         be printed.

2       Percentage formats     20   A    In  this case ###.## would allow  the 
                                         printing of 999.99 percent.

                                         in the Company Name File. The correct 
                                         name  to be used for reports is  read 
                                         into  system memory by  setting  this 
                                         number to match the TAG number of the

                                         account  number  here  and  the  last 
                                         account number in item 14 below.  The 
                                         numbers must EXACTLY match the  first 
                                         and   last   account   numbers...they 
                                         cannot  be 100 and 199 if,  in  fact, 
                                         the actual first and last numbers are 
                                         110 and 180!

14      High Balance Sheet     10   N    The high balance sheet account number

                                         general expenses.  This and the  next 
                                         entry are used to define the range of 
                                         numbers for COST OF GOODS.

16      High COST OF GOODS     10   N    This entry is used to define the high 
        Account Number                   cost  of goods account  number.  This 
                                         and  the  previous entry  follow  the

following -

2 - CHANGE GENERAL LEDGER SUBHEADINGS

3 - FINISHED

    These  operations are called in two parts.  The same  general 
information  applies for these entry programs as for the  general 
ledger  entry program.  The only entries currently used in  these 
records are the TAG,  ACCOUNT NUMBER,  DESCRIPTION, FIRST ACCOUNT 
NUMBER, and SECOND ACCOUNT NUMBER.

    The TAG and ACCOUNT NUMBER can be any value.  A suggestion is 
the  same number in each which might be 100 for ASSETS,  200  for 
LIABILITIES,  and so forth. TheDESCRIPTIONs should be in order as 
illustrated in the samples included here.

    The FIRST ACCOUNT NUMBER should be the lowest number used for 
accounts  of that category in the chart of accounts;  the  SECOND 
ACCOUNT NUMBER should be the highest number used.

    The remaining entries are not used at this time.

    Enter  the Headings and Subheadings in the appropriate  files 
and list them to ensure that they are what you want.

    The  request  that  appears  before  each  entry,  causes  an 
appropriate  prefix  to  be added to  each  description.  In  the 
Heading  entry  program  for  example,  ASSETS will  show  up  as 
HAASSETS.  The HA is used in the report and statement  generating 
programs  so don't be concerned that ASSETS is HAASSETS.  CURRENT 
ASSETS in the subheading entry program will show up as  SACURRECT 
ASSETS.  The heirarchy is ASSETS - HA or SA;  LIABILITIES - HL or 
SL; EQUITY - HE or SE; SALES - HS or SS; and EXPENSES - HX of SX.

Item #  Description            Size/Type Entry

1       Tag Number             4    N    This  number could be used as a  sort 
                                         parameter.  It MUST be non-zero since 
                                         a  zero  in this  field  indicates  a 
                                         deleted  record.  Otherwise it has no 
                                         significance.

2       Ledger Account Number  10   N    This   number  is  used  as  a   sort 
                                         parameter.   These   numbers   should 
                                         probably  best  be set to  match  the 
                                         first account number of each  account 
                                         number  group they head.  In this way 
                                         sorting   will  yield   a   correctly 
                                         ordered group of HEADINGS.

3       Description            30   A    This entry will be a description such 
                                         as ASSETS. The program will add H for 
                                         heading  and A for assets yielding an 
                                         entry of HAASETS.  The heading  entry 
                                         program    takes    care   of    this 
                                         automatically  after  asking  whether 
                                         the account is an  Asset,  Liability, 
                                         Equity, Sales, or Expense account.

4       First Account Number   10   N    This  entry must exactly specify  the 
                                         FIRST  account number used under this 
                                         heading.  A mistake often made is  to 
                                         select a range say of 100 to 199 then 
                                         make  the  first account  number  say 
                                         105.  If 100 is entered here, strange 
                                         things will happen...  you MUST enter 
                                         105!

5       Last Account Number    10   N    This entry follows the rules above!

                                         be  erased  once the  data  has  been 
                                         used.  You should only find data here 
                                         if  one  of the programs using  these 
                                         fields terminates in error.

GENERAL LEDGER SUBHEADINGS

                                         The   only  difference  between   the 
                                         headings  and subheadings is  in  the 
                                         prefix placed on the description.  In 
                                         the  subheading  files the prefix  SA 
                                         (SACurrent Assets) is used instead of 
                                         HA  thus identifying the record as  a 
                                         subheading.

#5 - This file can be set up for more than one name.  It is aimed 
at  future hard-disk operations in client writeup operations  but 
fares  very nicely in the floppy disk environment.  The name that 
will be used for the headings on all reports is controlled by  an 
entry  in  the General Ledger TABS file to be mentioned  shortly. 
The  Company  Name file is file "NM" on  the  diskette.  It  will 
contain,   in   addition   to  complete  address  and   telephone 
information, the Federal and State Tax Identification Numbers for

A SHORT GUIDE TO SETTING UP A CHART

Step 1 Enter  the  information required in the forms provided  in 
       the appendix.  This includes the actual chart of  accounts 
       followed by the headings and subheadings.  These forms may 
       not be required but they are provided as a convenience.

Step 2 Create the necessary file allowing a few more records than 
       needed   for  your  actual  numbered  accounts   - Assets, 
       Liabilities,  Equity,  Sales  and  Expenses.  Enter  these 
       account  numbers and descriptions remembering that the TAG 
       must be some value other than zero (0).

Step 3 Now sort the created file on account numbers and list  the 
       file.  When finished, allow a reference file to be created 
       by answering N to the question presented on exit.

Step 4 Enter  the Company Name.  Record the TAG for entry in  the 
       Tab file.

Step 5 Enter the Heading and Subheadings paying careful attention 
       to  the entry of first and last account numbers (range  of 
       account numbers) in each category.

Step 6 Enter the required dates.

Step 7 Enter  the required page width,  tabs and company name  in 
       use.

       You are now ready to list your Chart of Accounts. Make one 
       or   two  copies  for  a  record  of  the  Record  Numbers 
       associated with each account.  These numbers appear at the 
       left  side  of the listing and are asked  for  at  various 
       times   in  various  programs.   Keep  a  copy  handy  for 
       reference.

The General Ledger Journals
        
    The  BUSINESSMASTER  packages contain a  General  Journal,  a 
Check Disbursement Journal, and a Check Receipts Journal.
        
    Other  parts of this package post to the General  Ledger  but 
the  Journals  just  mentioned take care of a large part  of  the 
daily posting volume.
        
The General Journal
                             
    The  General Journal is used to post asset  acquisitions  and 
similar items to the General Ledger while maintaining a record of 
such  postings.  Each  entry  can  be posted over as  many  as  7 
accounts and using two or more records,  a posting could be  made 
over 14 or more accounts. 
        
    After each record or group of records is created, they can be 
listed and posted to the General Ledger. A listing should be made 
for  a permanent record.  The posting operation will generate  an 
audit  trail  record showing a General Ledger and a true  Journal 
listing.

2       Major Account Number   10   N    Normally a general journal is used to 
                                         record   miscellaneous  purchases  of 
                                         relatively high priced items that are 
                                         NOT   postable  through   the   check 
                                         disbursements   of   check   receipts 
                                         journals. The major account number in 
                                         the   case  of  the  purchase  of   a 
                                         vehicle,  for  example,  would be the 
                                         fixed asset account number associated 
                                         with such a purchase.  This and  item 
                                         #7   (Major  amount)  are  offset  by 
                                         double entry postings to one or  more 
                                         of the 6 allowable distributions.

                                         For accounting convenience, we DO NOT 
                                         FORCE  BALANCE.  Any  out of  balance 
                                         amount  is  shown in  the  DIFFERENCE 
                                         before  the  record  is  saved.  This 
                                         allows  for  OUT-OF-BALANCE  POSTINGS 
                                         which might be required for the entry 
                                         of  existing balances.  It is also  a 
                                         simple  matter to recall  and  modify 
                                         the entry if desired.

                                         All  account  numbers must  be  VALID 
                                         account   numbers  or  they  will  be 
                                         rejected during posting. In fact, the 
                                         posting programs first do an  account 
                                         number   validity  check   indicating 
                                         invalid  account numbers by  printing 
                                         them on the line printer. The posting 
                                         program   is  then  aborted   without 
                                         posting ANYTHING to allow the invalid 
                                         account numbers to be corrected.

The Check Disbursement Journal

    One  of  the most onerous bookkeeping chores is  posting  and 
distributing checks paid out by the business. This chore is taken 
care of with the Check Disbursements Journal.  Posting and  audit 
trail information are similar for all three journals. 

    These  Journals and the Check Receipts journal,  use the bank 
account  number  (General Ledger Account Number of  the  bank  on 
which  the  check is drawn - or to which a Receipt is  deposited) 
and  amount above the delimiter line for posting the  appropriate 
general  ledger bank account.  Distribution can be made  over  as 
many  as six additional accounts allowing posting to a total of 7 
different accounts. Unlike the General Journal, the use of two or 
more records is not recommended.
     
The Check Receipts Journal

    This  journal  follows the same general rules  as  the  Check 
Disbursements  journal but in this case the check amount will  be 
positive indicating a DEBIT to the bank account.  Notice that all 
General  Ledger  accounts  follow  the  accounting  principle  of 
posting DEBIT balances as positive amounts and CREDIT balances as 
negative amounts.

A sample Check Disbursement entry
        
    In  the  example  that follows,  a check to Western  Auto  is 
distributed  to  two accounts in addition to  the  bank  account. 
Notice  that  in  the original entry,  the AMOUNT  OF  CHECK  was 
incorrectly  entered.  The difference shows up as  460.00.  After 
correcting the amount to indicate a CREDIT (decrease) to the bank 
balance, the difference is 0 indicating an in-balance entry.

                            SECTION 3

                       Payroll Operations

Introduction
        
    This  payroll  package  is  essentially  self-contained.  The 
second  part  of  the  posting program is  interactive  with  the 
General  Ledger and will post directly to it with an audit  trail 
record showing the postings actually made.

Initial Operations
        
    There  are several things that must be done to establish  the 
payroll package. As it currently runs, only California income tax 
is   provided  for  so  it  will  be  necessary  to   incorporate 
information  in  the tax tables and in  the  payroll  calculation 
program to accomodate other states.
        
    The  cutoff and percentage figures should be entered for your 
particular  area.  The FICA cutoff and percentage is set  to  the 
latest  figure  when we ship the package.  The  State  Disability 
Insurance  figures are set for California and should be  changed, 
if required, for your local area. The Federal Unemployment figure 
and State Unemployment figures are for California...  here is the 
rule....The  Federal  Unemployment figure is currently  (December 
1978)  3.4%.  An  allowance of up to 2.7% is  allowed  for  State 
Unemployment.  This means that if your state unemployment is OVER 
2.7%,  Federal  Unemployment  will  be  0.7%.  To  determine  the 
percentage   then,   simply   subtract  the  State   unemployment 
percentage (if it is under 2.7%) from 3.4% to get the  percentage 
for Federal Unemployment. Federal Unemployment tax return is Form 
940. An accumulation of $100 or more, must be deposited.
        
    The  Federal and State unemployment is calculated and printed 
on  the payroll summary but it is not stored in any file at  this 
time. It will be necessary for you to maintain a running total on 
the  payroll  summary  sheets by  totalling  each  weeks  payroll 
figures for these amounts.

1       FICA Cutoff            12   N    This  and  the following entries  set 
                                         various  cutoffs and percentages  for 
                                         payroll  operations.  In each case  a 
                                         cutoff   followed  by  a   percentage 
                                         figure  is allowed.  These should  be 
                                         updated  once  a year  from  existing 
                                         payroll information.

There are nine parts to the system. These are:
        
      
1.  Update employee records.  This part of the program is used to 
    update the unit records maintained for each employee. 
        
Entering  Employee Information
        
You will need the following information:
   
1. Employee's name, address, city, state and zip code.
2. Employee's phone number.
3. Employee's social security number.
4. Employment date.
5. Marital Status.
6. Hourly or Salaried.
7. Pay period (weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly).
8. Number of exemptions.
9. Pay rate.
        
    The following questions should be answered before payroll  is 
    run each period.
        
      
1.  Did any employee leave during this pay period?  (If yes,  get 
    employee  #,  back  up the record in a history file  - delete 
    from the active file).
      
2.  Have any employee's joined the company? (If yes, get required 
    information,  make  a new employee record for both a  current 
    and backup file).
      
3.  Has  there been any change in status for  any  employee?  (If 
    yes, make appropriate changes in the employee records).
   
                         *** NOTICE ***
        
    If  you furnish an employee more that $50,000 Group-Term Life 
    Insurance,  the  COST of such coverage over $50,000  must  be 
    shown as extra income!!
        
    We strongly recommend that you update all employee records by 
    running the package with proper entries from the beginning of 
    the year.  In this way you will get complete records and have 
    some practice running the package if it is obtained midyear.

Item #  Description            Size/Type Entry

1       Employee Number        8    N    This  entry should be used to  record 
                                         an  employee  number of your  choice. 
                                         The  entry is free form but  must  be 
                                         non-zero.  It  is  a  sort  parameter 
                                         which means that employee records may 
                                         be   sorted   in   numerical   order. 
                                         Although  the programs required would 
                                         be  left  to  the  individual   used, 
                                         proper  use  of this employee  number 
                                         would  allow for the  development  of 
                                         departmentalized payroll information.

2       Account Number         10   N    This  entry can be used to  establish

                                         ledger  to which total payroll is  to 
                                         be posted.

                                         the  first  name  and  initial.  This 
                                         would  allow for the  development  of 
                                         search    programs   based   on   the 
                                         employee's last name.

2.  Enter  employee time cards.  This part of the program is used 
    to enter time for each employee.  It allows for the entry  of 
    time, time and one half, double time, sick time, holiday time 
    and   vacation  time.   It  also  allows  for  the  entry  of 
    miscellaneous  deductions  and  tips  or  other  income.  The 
    program segment is directly related to the employee record in 
    that it gets part of its information from that record.
   
Entering Employee's Time
        
    Employee's  time  is entered through the second part  of  the 
    payroll menu.  When first creating the file, make it the same 
    length as the employee data file.  The two programs  interact 
    in  that  on entry,  the time card files are cleared  by  the 
    program  and information copied from the employee records  to 
    each  of  the  active  time records.  Thus  the  only  record 
    retained is the listing forced on exit from the program.

                                         this  field can be used to record any 
                                         type  of extra pay not issued  on  an 
                                         hourly basis such as commissions.

6       misc deductions        12   N    This  should  be  used  to  record  a 
                                         composite of miscellaneous deductions 
                                         such  as insurance,  union dues,  and 
                                         others not recordable elsewhere.

7 through 12                   4    N    These  entries are  self-explanatory. 
                                         They  should  be used to  record  the 
                                         appropriate hours for pay purposes.

                                         Time  &  1/2 and  double  time  hours 
                                         should  be  recorded as  total  hours 
                                         worked in each category.  The program 
                                         will apply a 1.5 or 2 multiplications 
                                         factor  to  each  figure.   In  fact, 
                                         entering  twice  the actual hours  in 
                                         these  fields would allow for  triple 
                                         or  quadruple  time if  such  premium 
                                         periods were necessary.
      
3.  Calculate employee payroll. This part of the program actually 
    does  the  payroll  calculations using stored copies  of  the 
    annuallized federal and state tax tables. The algorithms used 
    are  shown later in this manual.  A separate  table  (epcuts) 
    establishes  the  cutoffs  and percentages  for  FICA,  State 
    Disability   Insurance,   Federal  Unemployment   and   State 
    Unemployment.  This  table is accessed for update through the 
    initialization  routines  as are the federal  and  state  tax 
    tables.
   
Calculating Payroll
        
    The  payroll is calculated and entered in the current records 
    of  the employee file automatically.  For states  other  than 
    California,  a  line  should  be entered in  the  calculation 
    program to allow for the entry of state income tax  manually, 
    or  a program should be developed to calculate such tax on  a 
    temporary basis.
        
4.  Print  Payroll Summary.  This part of the program generates a 
    comprehensive  payroll summary for each employee including  a 
    total  summary of all payroll for the period.  It also  flags 
    deposit requirements for federal 501 forms.
      
5.  Print  Employee checks.  This part of the programs  generates 
    the  payroll  checks using the NEBS checks.  The address  for 
    NEBS  (New  England Business Service) is shown  elsewhere  in 
    this manual.
      
6.  Post payroll operations.  This part of the program posts  the 
    employee records and the general ledger.
      
7.  Record Federal deposits.  This part of the program is used to 
    create  a  week  by week record of tax liability  and  actual 
    deposits made.  It is used during the preparation of Form 941 
    and  should  be  filled  in week by  week  to  ensure  proper 
    generation of Form 941.

Payroll Calculation Algorithms
        
    Federal and state withholding tax calculations are made using 
    the  Exact  Calculation  Method described  in  Circular  E  - 
    Employer's Tax Guide.  The tables used for these calculations 
    are in files EF and ES. These tables are loaded into matrices 
    by  the  tax calculation program and used to calculate  taxes 
    according to the algorithms shown below.
        
    All  calculations are done on an annualized  pay  basis.  For 
    hourly  employee's,  the  hours entered are multiplied  by  a 
    factor   determined  by  their  indicated  paydays   (weekly, 
    biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly) as shown elsewhere in this 
    manual.  Salaried  employee's hours are maintained but pay is 
    only calculated on the number of hours corresponding to their 
    paydays regardless of the number of hours entered.
        
    The  annualized  hours are multiplied by  the  payrate  which 
    should be entered for each employee as an HOURLY rate!!! This 
    annualized  figure is used for the calculation of Federal and 
    State withholding tax. FICA, FUTA, and SUTA are calculated on 
    the current pay. The calculated Federal and State withholding 
    amounts are then divided by the appropriate figure to  obtain 
    the current taxes.

FICA, Federal Unemployment, and State Unemployment
        
    FICA,   Federal  Unemployment,  and  State  Unemployment  are 
    calculated using figures obtained from the cutoff file (EPC). 
    These   figures  can  be  entered  or  changed  through   the 
    initialization  routines.  The  file  structure  and  current 
    settings  are  shown  in the Business  software  manual.  The 
    calculations  are comprehensive in that they test before  and 
    after  the current pay for an over-cutoff condition and  only 
    calculate  on that part of the current salary  that  actually 
    comes up to the cutoff level.
   
ACTUAL PAYROLL CALCULATIONS
      
1.  HOURS.  - The  hours  contained in the time card  record  are 
    read.  The  actual hours (H1) are developed by totalling  ALL 
    hours.  The  hours  for payroll calculation are developed  by 
    totalling  all hour but applying 1.5 and 2 times to time  and 
    one/half and double-time hours respectively.  The figure  for 
    ACTUAL  hours worked is stored for hourly employees while pay 
    is  calculated  on  effective hours (H4)  to  compensate  for 
    overtime.  Hours actually worked are also stored for salaried 
    employees  but the figure calculated on is based  on  whether 
    these  employees  are  weekly,   biweekly,   semimonthly,  or 
    monthly.
      
2.  FICA. - FICA is calculated using the following algorithm:
        
    If y-t-d gross pay > cutoff then FICA = 0
    If y-t-d gross pay + current gross pay > cutoff then
    FICA = y-t-d gross + current gross - cutoff * percentage
    If y-t-d gross + current gross <= cutoff then FICA =
    current gross * percentage

                            SECTION 4

             Accounts Receivable/Customer Operations

    The  entire  accounts receivable system works in  conjunction 
with  the  Inventory  and contains the Order  Entry  and  General 
Ledger posting operations.

    Generally  a  customer file is established as in  other  data 
entry  operations.   Customer's  names,   shipping  and   billing 
information  and  payment  information are all contained  in  the 
customer records. Orders are entered via a separate entry program 
that  calls  for  data  from both the  customer  record  and  the 
Inventory records.

    Up to 10 items may be entered for each order entry. A pair of 
Invoice  printing  programs  then allow  for  the  generation  of 
Invoices on either pre-printed (NEBS) Invoices or fully formatted 
on blank paper.

    As  each  Invoice  is generated,  the order entry  record  is 
flagged  to  indicate this.  The LIST CUSTOMER ORDERS  creates  a 
register of Invoices and this is also flagged in the order  entry 
record. Additionally, posting and payment are flagged. These four 
flags  allow  operations to continue on files which  contain  the 
orders  from previous days without duplicating operations already 
performed. They also allow for the generation of accrual or open-
item billing.

                            SECTION 6

              Inventory and Fixed Asset Operations

    The Inventory section carries two inventory files.  These are 
labelled FINISHED GOODS and RAW GOODS.

    The  Finished  Goods  inventory  is  the  inventory  actually 
accessed  by the Order Entry section of accounts  receivable.  By 
properly  maintaining  this  inventory it will  serve  about  any 
inventory accounting purpose desired. 

    If  new  numbers are assigned to items when  purchase  prices 
change  it  will serve as an exact value (as opposed to  LIFO  or 
FIFO)  inventory  of all material in stock.  Also,  since  it  is 
automatically decremented by the Order entry package,  it will be 
a perpetual inventory.

    Properly  maintained  with  manual  entries,  the  Raw  Goods 
inventory  can serve the same purpose for all material  purchased 
for use in manufacturing operations.

    The report printed for both of these inventories gives  total 
cost, total selling price, and a gross profit differential figure 
for  use  in  administration.  The information contained  in  the 
records  also  allows  for  the  calculation  of  economic  order 
quantities. In fact programs could be written to do this job.

    The  alert printed for each of these inventories  flags  both 
over  maximum  and under minimum quantities printing  only  those 
items which fall in these categories.

15      Quan Issued m-t-d      10   N    This  entry  is  incremented  by  the 
                                         number  of items invoiced as are  the 
                                         next  two  entries.  The  maintenance 
                                         program   will  zero  out  the  M-T-D 
                                         amounts  during monthly  maintenance, 
                                         leaving  quarter  and  year  to  date 
                                         amounts   to  be  incremented   still 
                                         further. In a similar manner the q-t-
                                         d and y-t-d issues will be zeroed out 
                                         during   those  maintenance   program 
                                         runs.  Thus y-t-d issues will  always 
                                         contain  the  total number  of  items 
                                         issued for the current year, the q-t-
                                         d issue will contain the total number 
                                         of  items  issued during the  current

                                         These  figures should prove useful in 
                                         establishing  inventory  levels   and

.pa
    This Capital Goods,  Fixed Asset,  or Depreciation Accounting 
package is designed to afford a means of calculating depreciation 
for  either  Income Tax purposes or internal  purposes.  You  may 
generate  one set of records for internal depreciation  of  fixed 
assets  using  any method of depreciation you chose and a  second 
set  which uses IRS approved depreciation methods  for  reporting 
purposes.
    
This package allows for the following direct calculation methods:
      
1.  Straight Line                    SL
2.  Sum-of-the-years-digits          SD
3.  Declining Balance @
    125%                             D1
    150%                             D2
    200%                             D3
    
and  affords  a  means  of applying  the  IRS  Class  Life  Asset 
Depreciation Range (CLADR) System of determining useful life.  By 
constructing  the  records correctly both Half Year  or  Modified 
Half  Year elections can be made for the particular vintage  year 
the  account  is  established.  See the RIA  Tax  Guide,  Revenue 
Procedure  72-10,   or  Publication  534,   Tax  Information   on 
Depreciation for additional details of this system.
    
    Because of the diversity of opinion and method in fixed asset 
accounting, this package makes no provision for direct posting to 
the   General   Ledger.   A  good  sourcebook  for  fixed   asset 
(depreciation)  accounting and accounting theory is the  Handbook 
of  Modern Accounting by Davidson and Weil published  by  McGraw-
Hill.
    
This package allows for the following:
    
1.   The  recording  of individual or multiple assets in  records      
     which  contain all current and historical data on the  asset      
     with  the  ability  to  edit and  revise  these  entries  as 
     desired.   These   accounts  may  be  carried  as   straight 
     depreciation accounts or as Vintage accounts as described in 
     the various references cited.
    
2.   The  calculation of depreciation each year using information 
     contained  in  the  record using any  of  the  5  previously 
     mentioned  IRS accepted calculation methods and allowing for 
     the   treatment  of  each  record  as  either   a   standard 
     depreciation or a CLADR vintage record.
    
3.   The  printing  of  a  condensed  depreciation  schedule  for      
     internal use.
    
4.   The printing of IRS Form 4562  DEPRECIATION for inclusion in 
     your tax return.
    
    It  will be necessary to post your General Ledger accounts as 
required through the General Journal Posting routines.
    
    It is also possible, using duplicate files, to carry internal 
depreciation one way and IRS depreciation another. A large number 
of  methods for accounting for the costs incurred in the  use  of 
fixed  assets are discussed in the Handbook of Modern Accounting. 
Again  we stress that if you are NOT a qualified  accountant,  by 
all means discuss this package WITH your accountant.

The Capital Goods Entry Program
    
    This  program is the first menu call.  We will go through the 
entries  one by one indicating any special effects they  have  on 
the operation of the program.
    
1.   TAG - This can be used as an in-house identification number. 
     It is shown as four bytes long but being a numeric entry, it 
     can probably be longer without adversely affecting operation 
     of the programs.
    
2.   FIXED  ASSET  ACCOUNT  # - This  number can  be used  as  an           
     indicator for posting purposes.
    
3.   DEPRECIATION  ACCOUNT # - This number can also be used as an 
     indicator for posting purposes.

4.   DESCRIPTION - This entry can contain  both numeric and alpha 
     data about the item in the record.  It could also contain an 
     identifying number. It is currently 24 bytes long.

5.   LOCATION  - This  is  another 24 byte  entry  specified  for 
     location but can be used for whatever purpose you desire.
    
6.   NEW  OR USED - This entry is a  single byte.  It  should  be 
     either N - new;  U - used; or V - Vintage. If the entry is N 
     or  U,  the account entry will be treated as  a  non-vintage 
     account  and  not subject to CLADR operations.  The  V  will 
     signify Vintage and the DATE information that follows should 
     be read carefully.
    
7.   DATE - The date has two uses. If the record contains an item 
     or items subject to standard depreciation,  it should be the 
     date entered in the form mm/dd/yy, where mm is the month, dd 
     the  day,  and yy the year.  This date is compared with  the 
     current date (in the regular date file). If the year part of 
     the  date in the date file matches the date  acquired  date, 
     the  item  is  treated as acquired during the  preceding  12 
     months or less. The month and day are then used to calculate 
     the  number  of  days  the asset has  been  owned  and  this 
     fraction  is used for depreciation calculation.  The  actual 
     calculation  program  should be run at the end of  the  year 
     with  the current date in the date file set to 12/31/xx.  It 
     can  be  run at other times of the year but  will  post  the 
     depreciation records as though it were the year-end.  Month-
     to-date  depreciation and quarter-to-date  depreciation  are 
     not  precisely  what they seem.  They are set to 1/12th  and 
     1/4th of the years depreciation.
    
     The  second  mutually exclusive use is as a vintage  account 
     flag   when  the  record  is  being  run  under  IRS   CLADR 
     depreciation.  If  using the Half-year convention,  the date 
     should  be  set to H00xx where xx is the  vintage  year.  If 
     using the Modified Half-year convention,  the date should be 
     entered as M01xx or M02xx depending on whether the asset  is 
     acquired  before or after the middle of the year.  01 is the 
     first  half  year;  02 the second.  xx is still the  vintage 
     date.  Using  CLADR  life and  the  above  conventions,  the 
     calculation program will do CLADR depreciation.
    
8.   DEPRECIATION METHOD - For either depreciation  method above, 
     the  following elections are possible - SL = straight  line; 
     D1  = declining balance at 125%;  D2 = declining balance  at 
     150%;  D3  = declining balance at 200% (maximum);  and SD  = 
     Sum-of-the-years  digits.  The calculation program looks  at 
     this entry to determine which depreciation program to use.
    
9.   COST OR BASIS - This is the initial depreciable  cost of the 
     equipment.  This  entry is not changed by any program in the 
     system and should match the entry in item 10 initially.

10.  DEPRECIABLE  BASIS - This entry is used in  caculations  and 
     posted  down during the calculation program to  reflect  the 
     new basis after a years depreciation.
    
11.  PRIOR YEARS DEPRECIATION - This amount should, when added to 
     item 10, be equal to item 9 at any point in the cycle.
    
12.  USEFUL  LIFE  - This entry  need not be present for  vintage 
     accounts. It should be set to the useful life figure for the 
     item for other methods of depreciation.
    
13.  REMAINING  LIFE  - This value should  be  entered  initially 
     equal  to  item  12.  It  is posted down  1  each  time  the 
     calculation program is run.
    
14,15   and   16  - These  are  posted  during  the  running   of 
     calculations.
    
17.  SALVAGE VALUE - This  value whether 0 or positive is used to 
     set the lower limit of depreciation.


     It is possible to construct a sample set of records and  run 
the  complete  cycle through to the end of the asset life to  see 
the effect of various depreciation methods.
    
     The  election  of  a 20%  first-year  depreciation  is  also 
provided for in the calculations part of this package.

4       Description            24   A    This    field   should   contain    a 
                                         description  of the item or items  as 
                                         they will appear on the  depreciation 
                                         report and Form 4562.

5       Location               24   A    This  field is here as a  convenience 
                                         to   the  user  to  mantain  location 
                                         information.

6       New or Used            1    A    This field should either be an N or a 
                                         U.

7       Date Acquired          8    A    The  format  used for entry  of  this 
                                         field should be mm/dd/yy.  This  date 
                                         will   be  used  to  compute  partial 
                                         depreciation  from the date  acquired 
                                         to  the end of the reporting  period. 
                                         This  date is also compared with  the 
                                         current year to determine eligibility 
                                         for  first-year   depreciation.   One 
                                         exception  exists...  if  this  is  a 
                                         CLADR  vintage  account,   the  entry 
                                         should  be in the form H1979 for half 
                                         year   calculations  or   M1979   for 
                                         modified   half  year  methods.   The 
                                         program looks at the FIRST character. 
                                         If  this  character is M or H  it  is 
                                         treated  as  a  vintage  account  and 
                                         depreciation      is       calculated 
                                         accordingly.  If it is a numeral, the 
                                         account  is  treated  as  a  standard 
                                         account  and depreciation  calculated 
                                         in the normal way.

8       Depreciation Method    2    A    The  format  for the following  field 
                                         MUST be SL for Straight Line,  D1 for 
                                         Declining   Balance  125%,   D2   for 
                                         Declining   Balance  150%,   D3   for 
                                         Declining Balance 200%, or SD for sum 
                                         of  the  years  digits.  Depreciation 
                                         will be calculated accordingly.

9       Cost or Basis          12   N    This   field   should   contain   the 
                                         original cost or other basis on which 
                                         depreciation is to be calculated.

10      Depreciable Basis      12   N    This  field will be depleted  by  the 
                                         program  to  form a  new  depreciable 
                                         basis for each succeeding year.

11      Prior Years Dep.       12   N    This field will be incremented by one 
                                         for each years depreciation taken.

12      Useful Life            4    N    You should enter here the useful life 
                                         of the asset.

13      Remaining Life         4    N    This  field will hold the  difference 
                                         of   useful  life  and  prior   years 
                                         depreciation.

14      Month to date dep.     12   N    This field will be one twelfth (1/12) 
                                         of   the  y-t-d   depreciation.   The 
                                         calculation program calculates a full 
                                         years   depreciation  and  will  then 
                                         divide  by 4 to get q-t-d  and 12  to 
                                         get m-t-d.  A copy of the file should 
                                         be  made to run month or  quarter  to 
                                         date depreciation and the master file 
                                         run  through the calculation  program 
                                         only once a year.

15      Quarter to date dep.   12   N    See Above.

16      Year to date dep.      12   N    See Above.

17      Salvage Value          12   N    When  remaining value falls below the 
                                         value  you enter  here,  depreciation 
                                         calculations will be stopped on  this 
                                         asset.

                     Mailing List Operations

    This  group  of mailing list programs is designed to  provide 
some   minimum  capabilities  in  the  maintenance  of   in-house 
advertising  mailing  lists.  The packagealso  provides  for  the 
printing of labels for customers, vendors, and employeesusing the 
files associated with each of these.

    Both the programs and the documentation are due for expansion 
to provide additional features.

    The  list,  once  entered  can  be sorted on  either  tag  or 
reference number.  We suggest the zip code as a reference  number 
for the startup of the system.

                    Using the label printers

    Each  label  printer allows for the selection of from 1 to  5 
labels across the page. A second selection determines the spacing 
between labels.

    If  the  number  of labels is set for  one  (1),  the  second 
selection  will determine the distance over to the single  label, 
allowing  the  printing of tipped  continuous-form  envelopes.  A 
pause  could also be inserted to allow the printing  ofindividual 
envelopes.

    The  last  selection  indicates the  number  of  line  spaces 
between labels.
